Install Node 0.12:

This is derived from a very early version of [Windshaft](https://github.com/CartoDB/Windshaft) which is probably better if you can run under Linux and PostGIS. The purpose of this module is that it uses modified MapBox modules [grainstore](http://github.com/BHare1985/grainstore) and [millstone](http://github.com/BHare1985/millstone) to allow it to run under Windows or Linux.
